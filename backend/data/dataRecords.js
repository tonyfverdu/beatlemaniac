    "genre": "Pop-Rock",
    "description": "The Beatles, also known colloquially as the White Album, is the ninth studio album and only double album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 1968. Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed. This was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, British blues, ska, music hall, pre-heavy metal and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. The album features 30 songs, 19 of which were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; several of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than most of their releases since Revolver (1966). The Beatles also broke with the band's tradition at the time of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.",
    "comments": "The Beatles received favourable reviews from most music critics; detractors found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. It topped record charts in Britain and the United States. No singles were issued in either territory, but <<Hey Jude>> and <<Revolution>> originated from the same recording sessions and were issued on a single in August 1968. The album has been certified 24× platinum by the RIAA. A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2018 to celebrate its 50th anniversary.",

    "comments": "Unlike the 1962–1966 collection, the Blue Album was largely the same in the US and UK, although there were some variations. The US edition had <<Strawberry Fields Forever>> in its original 1967 stereo mix while both <<Penny Lane>> and <<Hello, Goodbye>> were presented in fake stereo, and <<I Am the Walrus>> with a four-beat electric piano introduction; the UK version had the more common six-beat beginning. The albums had several other variants and anomalies. <<Get Back>> was described as the album version in the US liner notes, although it was in fact the single version. In both countries, <<Hey Jude>> was around nine seconds shorter than it had been on the original single, although the full length was restored for the 1993 compact disc edition. The original vinyl version faded in during the crowd noise at the beginning of <<A Day in the Life>>. The fade in was different on both the UK and US versions. The original compact disc edition, meanwhile, featured a clean version previously heard on the Imagine: John Lennon soundtrack album in 1988. In the Spanish edition <<One After 909>> replaced <<The Ballad of John and Yoko>>, a song that had been banned from the airwaves shortly after being released as a single in 1969, for its allusions to <<Christ>> and <<Gibraltar>> in the lyrics",

Following a deserved holiday, the guys returned to the studios in mid October, not only to record the album but also a new single - their first double A-side featuring <<Day Tripper>> and <<We Can Work It Out>>.",
    "comments": "In the US Rubber Soul was released but despite the fact that sleeve looked similar to its UK counterpart, the track listing was different. Of the twelve tracks released on the American album only ten were common to the UK version. 'I've Just Seen A Face' and 'It's Only Love' from side two of the British Help! album replaced four tracks which the US would save for a future release titled <<Yesterday....And Today>>. The US <<Rubber Soul>> album reached # 1 in early January 1966 and stayed there for six weeks during an initial chart run of 51 weeks.",

    "description": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single <<Eleanor Rigby>> / <<Yellow Submarine>>. The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content. The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are <<Tomorrow Never Knows>>, incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; <<Eleanor Rigby>>, a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and <<Love You To>>, a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, <<Paperback Writer>> backed with <<Rain>>.",
    "comments": "In the United Kingdom, the album's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today. The release there coincided with the Beatles' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon's remark that the band had become <<more popular than Jesus>>. The album topped the Record Retailer chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press's unease at the band's outspokenness on contemporary issues.",

In 1976, Parlophone released the eleven-track LP in the UK. When recording their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since Revolver (1966). The project was initiated by Paul McCartney in April 1967, but after the band recorded the song <<Magical Mystery Tour>>, it lay dormant until the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, in late August. Recording then took place alongside filming and editing, and as the Beatles furthered their public association with Transcendental Meditation under teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.",
    "comments": "Despite widespread media criticism of the Magical Mystery Tour film, the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In the UK, it topped the EPs chart compiled by Record Retailer and peaked at number 2 on the magazine's singles chart (later the UK Singles Chart) behind <<Hello, Goodbye>>. The album topped Billboard's Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969. With the international standardisation of the Beatles' catalogue in 1987, Magical Mystery Tour became the only Capitol-generated LP to supersede the band's intended format and form part of their core catalogue.",

In 2000, it was voted 119th in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2020, it was ranked 266th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the <<500 Greatest Albums of All Time>>.

The album topped Record Retailer's LP chart for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement for a pop album at that time.

Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by the songwriting partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney (originally credited <<McCartney–Lennon>>). Rolling Stone magazine later cited these original compositions as early evidence of the Beatles' the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments.Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone's list of the <<500 Greatest Albums of All Time>> (2012), and number 622 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).",

It was released in the United Kingdom on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, eight months after the band's debut Please Please Me. Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon–McCartney and <<Don't Bother Me>>, George Harrison's first recorded solo composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six covers (mostly of rock and roll and Motown R&B hits). The sessions also yielded the non-album single, <<I Want to Hold Your Hand>> backed by <<This Boy>>. The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.",
    "comments": "In the United States, the album's tracks were unevenly split over the group's first two albums released on Capitol Records: Meet the Beatles! and The Beatles' Second Album. It was also released in Canada under the name Beatlemania! With the Beatles. The album was ranked number 420 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2010). It was also voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).",

    "description": "<<Beatles for Sale>> is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI's Parlophone label. The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterised the Beatles' previous work, partly due to the band's exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. Beatles for Sale was not widely available in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was standardised for release on CD. Instead, eight of the album's fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records' concurrent release, Beatles '65, issued in North America only. The sessions for Beatles for Sale also produced a non-album single, <<I Feel Fine>> backed by <<She's a Woman>>. During the sessions, the band ventured into studio experimentation, such as employing a fade-in and incorporating guitar feedback, and supplemented the basic recordings with percussion instruments such as timpani, African hand drums and chocalho. The album reflects the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan, whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964. Partly as a result of the group's hectic schedule, only eight of the tracks are original compositions, with cover versions of songs by artists such as Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Little Richard being used to complete the album. The original songs introduced darker musical moods and more introspective lyrics, with John Lennon adopting an autobiographical perspective in <<I'm a Loser>> and <<No Reply>>.",
    "comments": "Beatles for Sale received favourable reviews in the UK musical press, where it held the number one spot for 11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the top 20. The album was similarly successful in Australia, where the band's cover of Berry's <<Rock and Roll Music>> also topped the singles chart. One of the songs omitted from the US version of the album, <<Eight Days a Week>>, became the Beatles' seventh number one in the US when issued as a single there in February 1965. In 2000, it was voted number 204 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums.",

It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released <<Yellow Submarine>> and <<All You Need Is Love>>. The remainder of the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin. The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before – and issued two months after – the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the <<White Album>>) and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters.",
    "comments": "The Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed.",

    "description": "Yesterday and Today (also rendered as <<Yesterday>> ... and Today in part of the original packaging)[3] is a studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released in the United States and Canada in June 1966, it was their ninth album issued on Capitol Records and twelfth American release overall. Typical of the Beatles' North American discography until 1967, the album contains songs that Capitol had withheld from its configurations of the band's recent EMI albums, along with songs that the group had released elsewhere on non-album singles. Among its 11 tracks are songs from the EMI albums Help! and Rubber Soul, and three new 1966 recordings that would appear on Revolver in countries outside North America. Yesterday and Today is remembered primarily for the controversy surrounding its original cover image. Known as the <<butcher cover>>, it was taken by photographer Robert Whitaker and shows the band dressed in white coats and covered with decapitated baby dolls and pieces of raw meat. Although the photo was intended to be part of a larger work critiquing the adulation afforded the Beatles, the band members insisted it was a statement against the Vietnam War. Others interpreted it as the Beatles protesting the record company's policy of <<butchering>> their albums for the North American market. In response to retailers' outrage at the gory subject matter, Capitol immediately withdrew the LP and replaced the cover image with a shot of the band posed around a <<steamer>> trunk..",
    "comments": "The album's title plays on that of the song <<Yesterday>>. The original LP became a highly prized item among collectors. Since some of Capitol's pressing plants merely pasted the trunk image onto the existing LP covers, the album also encouraged a phenomenon of stripping back the top layer of artwork in the search for a banned butcher cover. Having been deleted from Capitol's catalogue in 1986, Yesterday and Today was reissued on CD in 2014.",

There is an extremely rare 8 track tape version of this album, which approximately 10 to 15 copies still exist today.

As the Beatles had not accumulated many original songs by this time, the majority of their BBC performances consisted of cover versions, drawing on the repertoire that they had developed for their early stage act. In total, 275 performances of 88 different songs were broadcast, of which 36 songs never appeared on their studio albums. Several of the programmes aired live, but most were recorded days (or occasionally weeks) ahead of the broadcast date.[6] The BBC's studio facilities were not as advanced as those at Abbey Road, offering only monaural recording (no multitracking) and basic overdubbing; few retakes of songs could be attempted owing to time limitations.[7] It was not the BBC's practice to archive either the session tapes or the shows' master tapes, owing to storage space and contractual restrictions.",

    "description": "The album includes material from the Beatles' days as the Quarrymen, through the Decca audition to sessions for the album Beatles for Sale. It is of historical interest as the only official release of performances with Best and Sutcliffe in the band - Sutcliffe, the band's original bass player during 1960, and sporadically during the group's second Hamburg season, appears on the disc-one tracks <<Hallelujah, I Love Her So>>, <<You'll Be Mine>> and <<Cayenne>>; while Best, who was the official drummer from just prior to the group's first departure for Hamburg in August 1960 until 15 August 1962 when he was replaced by Ringo Starr, is on Disc One, tracks 10–12, 15–19 and 21–22. Disc One, tracks 10–12, were recorded at a session in Hamburg where the Beatles served as the back-up band to the English rock and roll musician Tony Sheridan. Some songs from this session were released on the 1962 album My Bonnie, credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers. The song <<My Bonnie>> would be their introductory single in England, featuring Sheridan on lead vocal and guitar. Tracks 21–22 are the only surviving recordings of the Beatles' first EMI session. Track 22 is the original recording of <<Love Me Do>>, which would be re-recorded by the group four months later for their first single. Track 24 features EMI session drummer Andy White, in place of Ringo. Disc Two contains performances from comedy duo Morecambe and Wise's popular television programme, Two of a Kind, as well as the opening song from their famed performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which introduced the band to most of the US in 1964. The flash-point for the album came with the song <<Free as a Bird>> – the three remaining Beatles Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr re-working a John Lennon demo recording given to McCartney by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Produced by Harrison's Traveling Wilburys bandmate Jeff Lynne, the three added additional music and lyrics, instrumentation and backing vocals, with McCartney and Harrison both taking a turn at a lead vocal. The live BBC Radio recording of <<Lend Me Your Comb>> was held back from Live at the BBC for inclusion on this album, but it was later also included on On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2.",
    "comments": "Anthology 1 is a compilation album by the Beatles, released on 20 November 1995 by Apple Records as part of The Beatles Anthology series. It features rarities, outtakes and live performances from the period 1958–64, including songs with original bass player Stuart Sutcliffe and drummer Pete Best. It is the first in a trilogy of albums with Anthology 2 and Anthology 3, all of which tie in with the televised special The Beatles Anthology. It contains <<Free as a Bird>>, the first new Beatles song in 25 years, which was released as a single two weeks after Anthology 1. The album topped the Billboard 200 album chart and was certified 8× Platinum by the RIAA. It reached number 2 on the UK albums chart. The Anthology albums were remastered and made available digitally on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011, individually and as part of the Anthology Box Set.",

    "description": "Real Love, as with <<Free as a Bird>>, is based on a demo made by John Lennon and given to Paul McCartney by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. The three surviving Beatles (McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) added guitars, bass, drums, percussion and backing vocals, but unlike with the previous song, did not re-work the lyrics or music. <<Real Love>> remained solely credited to Lennon, becoming the only Beatles song to have Lennon by himself in the writing credit. Disc one contains three unreleased compositions, one being an instrumental entitled <<12-Bar Original>>, recorded for Rubber Soul but subsequently unused. Two other songs recorded for Help!, <<If You've Got Trouble>> and <<That Means a Lot>>, were abandoned and never returned to again by the band. The former was originally slated to be the usual vocal spot for Ringo Starr on Help!, and the latter was eventually given to singer P.J. Proby. The version of <<Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby>> from the group's famed August 1965 show at Shea Stadium but left out of the documentary about the show appears for the first time. <<I'm Down>> was originally listed as Track 7 (in its correct place chronologically) but was shifted out of sequence to Track 3 at the last minute, at Paul McCartney's request. The album had already gone to press and McCartney reportedly paid the re-printing costs himself. Disc two contains work-in-progress versions of tracks from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour. The take of <<Strawberry Fields Forever>> that made up the first minute of the released record appears in its entirety on track three. Also included are three songs that were started during this period – <<Only a Northern Song>>, <<You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)>> and <<Across the Universe>> – but would not see release until years later, in 1969 and 1970. McCartney had hoped to include <<Carnival of Light>>, an unreleased experimental piece that the Beatles recorded during the sessions for Sgt. Pepper in 1967; however, the idea was vetoed by Harrison, Starr and Ono on the grounds that the track was never intended for a Beatles release. Among the songs that were in the running for inclusion on the compilation but ultimately passed over were the following: the 1965 Shea Stadium performance of <<She's a Woman>>; a live version of <<Nowhere Man>>, recorded in Tokyo in 1966; <<Paperback Writer>>, featuring only vocals; and out-takes of <<Think for Yourself>>.",
    "comments": "Anthology 2 is a compilation album by the Beatles, released on 18 March 1996 by Apple Records as part of The Beatles Anthology series. It features rarities, outtakes and live performances from the 1965 sessions for Help! to the sessions just prior to their trip to India in February 1968. It is the second in a trilogy of albums with Anthology 1 and Anthology 3, all of which tie in with the televised special The Beatles Anthology. The opening track is <<Real Love>>, the second of the two recordings that reunited the Beatles for the first time since the band's break-up. Like its predecessor, the album topped the Billboard 200 album chart and has been certified 4× Platinum by the RIAA.",

    "description": "Following <<Free as a Bird>> on Anthology 1 and <<Real Love>> on Anthology 2, a third John Lennon solo demo entitled <<Now and Then>> was to be reworked by the three surviving members of The Beatles (George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) for Anthology 3. However, this project was shelved due to Harrison's dislike of the song. McCartney later stated that Harrison called Lennon's demo recording <<fucking rubbish>>. McCartney told Q Magazine in 1997 that <<George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it.>> In its place is <<A Beginning>>, an orchestral instrumental track by the band's producer George Martin, initially intended for the White Album as the intro to <<Don't Pass Me By>>. Connecting to the previous Anthology albums, the cover image painted by Klaus Voormann features a collage of Beatles-related imagery designed to appear as a wall of peeling posters and album covers. An updated picture of Voormann can be seen in Harrison's hair in a segment of the Revolver album cover.",
    "comments": "Anthology 3 is a compilation album by the Beatles, released on 29 October 1996 by Apple Records as part of The Beatles Anthology series. The album includes rarities and alternative tracks from the final three years of the band's career, ranging from the initial sessions for The Beatles (better known as <<the White Album>>) to the last sessions for Let It Be and Abbey Road in 1969 and early 1970. It is the last in a trilogy of albums with Anthology 1 and Anthology 2, all of which tie in with the televised special The Beatles Anthology. The album was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA and was the group's third double album in a row to reach number one on the US charts, equalling a record set by Donna Summer in the 1970s. The Anthology albums were remastered and made available digitally on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011, individually and as part of the Anthology Box Set.",

    "description": "Paul's solution was for the group to <<get back>> to their roots, i.e. record their album like they used to without studio gimmicks and overdubs. Paul also wanted to Beatles to <<get back>> to playing live and a couple of locations were discussed (such as a Roman amphitheatre, or as Lennon sarcastically suggested, <<an insane asylum>>!) and it was originally agreed to film the rehearsals for a TV documentary. (It's interesting to note that Paul continued this theme with the original Wings!) Additionally, the songs written for 'Get Back' just weren't as strong as those from the 'White Album', perhaps resulting from the fact that the Beatles basically jumped right into their new project without having much time to write any new material. This time there was no luxury of a couple of months in India to compose the songs.",
    "comments": "By 1968 the Beatles were in trouble. Their manager Brian Epstein had died; they had quit touring to become a studio-only band; they formed Apple records with a naive utopian vision and very little business sense. While The Beatles visit to the Maharishi in India injected new energy into the band, it was short lived. The resulting songs on the <<White Album>> and the <<Hey Jude/Revolution>> single. Tensions were high during the recording of the <<White Album>>, in fact Ringo quit the band for a short time.",

    "description": "Reduced from 170 to 23 songs, Anyone who hopes that <<Anthology Highlights>> will contain songs that were discarded fifteen years ago, such as <<Carnival Of Light>> from the <<Sgt. Pepper Sessions>> or the third new song <<All For Love>> would still be released, will be disappointed. You quickly realize that some real highlights like the vibraphone version of « I'm Only Sleeping» or only the strings of « Eleanor Rigby », but also the earliest recordings of the Quarrymen in 1957 are missing. At that time, 170 songs were released on the three double albums and singles. <<Anthology Highlights>> has 23 left. Those who want to get an idea of ​​the Beatles' working process are better off with the three albums. If you just want to have a quick listen, we recommend «Anthology Highlights».",
    "comments": "When the Beatles told their story in a television special in 1995 and 1996 and opened their musical archive on three double albums, it was an event. The albums featured unreleased songs, early stages of hits, and discarded versions of their songs alongside live recordings. The restored recordings were of particularly good sound quality and set standards.",

    "description": "All 13 unique albums released by Capitol Records are included in the box set (eight of which were previously released in The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2—which, unlike the U.S. Albums set, were sourced from the Capitol master tapes). The set contains remastered mono and stereo versions of each album, except The Beatles' Story and Hey Jude, which are presented only in stereo. Additionally, Yesterday and Today, and the US versions of A Hard Day's Night and Revolver were released for the first time on CD in this box set. The Beatles' Story (in stereo only) is the only album from the box set that is not available separately. The masters for the US versions of the albums are partially based on the original 1960s masters delivered by EMI and the 2009 remasters released in The Beatles (The Original Studio Recordings) and The Beatles in Mono. Unique stereo and mono mixes prepared in the UK for US release are sourced from the original tapes. Any unique versions prepared for US release were recreated for this set. The tapes used for the 2004 and 2006 Capitol boxed sets drawn from the Capitol tapes were not used in this set, with the exception of The Beatles' Story. The albums Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, The Beatles (the <<White Album>>), Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be are not included in this set as those albums were identical to available UK editions (although the US edition of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band does not have the inner groove sound featured on the UK edition). Plus, the White Album was released only in stereo in the US. Originally, the American version of Magical Mystery Tour was also unique, as a Capitol Records compilation of the band's British EP and 1967 singles. When the Beatles catalogue was first issued on compact disc in 1987, the American Magical Mystery Tour running order was chosen as the official version of the release.",

    "description": "A lifelong fan of the Beatles, Hawke compiled The Black Album for his daughter Maya following his divorce from her mother Uma Thurman, and presented it to her on her 13th birthday on 8 July 2011. The record consisted of 51 songs from the Beatles' members following their breakup in 1970. John Lennon had 19 songs on the compilation from his solo career and his collaborations with the Plastic Ono Band, Paul McCartney had 20 from his solo career and his collaborations with Wings and Linda McCartney, George Harrison had seven songs from his solo career, and Ringo Starr had four. Additionally, the song <<Real Love>>—a Lennon demo reworked and overdubbed by McCartney, Harrison and Starr for the compilation Anthology 2—was included on The Black Album. Included with the three-disc collection was a set of liner notes in the form of a personalised letter from Hawke to his daughter, explaining his motivation for creating the album. Critical reaction to Hawke's compilation was generally positive. In an analysis of The Black Album, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News suggested that the record was <<a metaphor for divorce>>, and noted that Hawke had selected tracks that were recorded as the Beatles' members were approaching maturity and writing songs about more mature subject matter. Trey Barrineau of USA Today said the album was <<quite a compilation>>, while Peter Howell of the Toronto Star called it <<unique>>. The Desert Sun described it as <<a great listen>> and were inspired to create their own shorter version of the album, which featured only 12 tracks consisting of solo material from 1970 to 1971.",
    "comments": "The Black Album (stylised as The BLACK ALBUM) is an unofficial compilation album of solo material by members of the British rock group The Beatles. It was created by the American actor Ethan Hawke, and became widely known as a result of its inclusion in Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood. Hawke compiled the record to give to his daughter Maya on her 13th birthday in 2011, including personalised liner notes; it was then incorporated into Boyhood in scenes shot later that year, with Hawke's character giving it to his son as a birthday present. The compilation contains 51 tracks from Beatles members following the band's breakup in 1970. Critical reaction to The Black Album was generally positive: The Desert Sun described it as <<a great listen>>, while USA Today called it <<quite a compilation>>.
