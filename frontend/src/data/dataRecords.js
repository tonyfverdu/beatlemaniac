For the fourth time in the UK, no single was lifted from the album and this also held true in the US. The album was also not banded, encouraging the listener to play it all the way through, pausing only to turn the disc over.",

The high-pitched tone and the garbled speech embedded in the UK run-out groove did not appear on the American release. The album enjoyed a fifteen week stay at the top of the US Top 200 albums during its initial chart run of 88 weeks",

    "description": "The Beatles, also known colloquially as the White Album, is the ninth studio album and only double album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 1968. Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed. This was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, British blues, ska, music hall, pre-heavy metal and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. The album features 30 songs, 19 of which were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; several of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than most of their releases since Revolver (1966). The Beatles also broke with the band's tradition at the time of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.",
    "comments": "The Beatles received favourable reviews from most music critics; detractors found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. It topped record charts in Britain and the United States. No singles were issued in either territory, but <<Hey Jude>> and <<Revolution>> originated from the same recording sessions and were issued on a single in August 1968. The album has been certified 24× platinum by the RIAA. A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2018 to celebrate its 50th anniversary.",

    "description": "Tellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 13 January 1969 in the United States and on 17 January in the United Kingdom. It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released <<Yellow Submarine>> and <<All You Need Is Love>>. The remainder of the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin. The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before – and issued two months after – the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the <<White Album>>) and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters.",
    "comments": "The Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed.",

The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the Parlophone label, while the Capitol Records LP release in the US and Canada occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year. In 1976, Parlophone released the eleven-track LP in the UK. When recording their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since Revolver (1966). The project was initiated by Paul McCartney in April 1967, but after the band recorded the song <<Magical Mystery Tour>>, it lay dormant until the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, in late August. Recording then took place alongside filming and editing, and as the Beatles furthered their public association with Transcendental Meditation under teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.",
    "comments": "Despite widespread media criticism of the Magical Mystery Tour film, the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In the UK, it topped the EPs chart compiled by Record Retailer and peaked at number 2 on the magazine's singles chart (later the UK Singles Chart) behind <<Hello, Goodbye>>. The album topped Billboard's Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969. With the international standardisation of the Beatles' catalogue in 1987, Magical Mystery Tour became the only Capitol-generated LP to supersede the band's intended format and form part of their core catalogue.",

    "description": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single <<Eleanor Rigby>> / <<Yellow Submarine>>. The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content. The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are <<Tomorrow Never Knows>>, incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; <<Eleanor Rigby>>, a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and <<Love You To>>, a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, <<Paperback Writer>> backed with <<Rain>>.",
    "comments": "In the United Kingdom, the album's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today. The release there coincided with the Beatles' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon's remark that the band had become <<more popular than Jesus>>. The album topped the Record Retailer chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press's unease at the band's outspokenness on contemporary issues.",

The second side includes <<Yesterday>>, the most-covered song ever written.[3] The album was met with favourable critical reviews and topped the Australian, German, UK and US charts. During the recording sessions for the album, the Beatles continued to explore the studio's multitracking capabilities to layer their sound. <<Yesterday>> features a string quartet, the band's first use of Baroque sensibilities, and <<You've Got to Hide Your Love Away>> includes a flute section. The North American release is a true soundtrack album, combining the first seven songs with instrumental music from the film. The omitted tracks are instead spread across the Capitol Records LPs Beatles VI, Rubber Soul and Yesterday and Today.",
    "comments": "In the US, Help! marked the start of artistic recognition for the Beatles from mainstream critics, including comparisons to the European art music tradition. It was nominated in the category of Album of the Year at the 1966 Grammys Awards, marking the first time that a rock band had been recognised in this category. In 2000, it was voted 119th in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2020, it was ranked 266th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the <<500 Greatest Albums of All Time>>.

The album topped Record Retailer's LP chart for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement for a pop album at that time.

Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by the songwriting partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney (originally credited <<McCartney–Lennon>>). Rolling Stone magazine later cited these original compositions as early evidence of the Beatles' the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments.Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone's list of the <<500 Greatest Albums of All Time>> (2012), and number 622 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).",

    "description": "<<Beatles for Sale>> is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI's Parlophone label. The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterised the Beatles' previous work, partly due to the band's exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. Beatles for Sale was not widely available in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was standardised for release on CD. Instead, eight of the album's fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records' concurrent release, Beatles '65, issued in North America only. The sessions for Beatles for Sale also produced a non-album single, <<I Feel Fine>> backed by <<She's a Woman>>. During the sessions, the band ventured into studio experimentation, such as employing a fade-in and incorporating guitar feedback, and supplemented the basic recordings with percussion instruments such as timpani, African hand drums and chocalho. The album reflects the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan, whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964. Partly as a result of the group's hectic schedule, only eight of the tracks are original compositions, with cover versions of songs by artists such as Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Little Richard being used to complete the album. The original songs introduced darker musical moods and more introspective lyrics, with John Lennon adopting an autobiographical perspective in <<I'm a Loser>> and <<No Reply>>.",
    "comments": "Beatles for Sale received favourable reviews in the UK musical press, where it held the number one spot for 11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the top 20. The album was similarly successful in Australia, where the band's cover of Berry's <<Rock and Roll Music>> also topped the singles chart. One of the songs omitted from the US version of the album, <<Eight Days a Week>>, became the Beatles' seventh number one in the US when issued as a single there in February 1965. In 2000, it was voted number 204 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums.",

    "description": "Yesterday and Today (also rendered as <<Yesterday>> ... and Today in part of the original packaging)[3] is a studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released in the United States and Canada in June 1966, it was their ninth album issued on Capitol Records and twelfth American release overall. Typical of the Beatles' North American discography until 1967, the album contains songs that Capitol had withheld from its configurations of the band's recent EMI albums, along with songs that the group had released elsewhere on non-album singles. Among its 11 tracks are songs from the EMI albums Help! and Rubber Soul, and three new 1966 recordings that would appear on Revolver in countries outside North America. Yesterday and Today is remembered primarily for the controversy surrounding its original cover image. Known as the <<butcher cover>>, it was taken by photographer Robert Whitaker and shows the band dressed in white coats and covered with decapitated baby dolls and pieces of raw meat. Although the photo was intended to be part of a larger work critiquing the adulation afforded the Beatles, the band members insisted it was a statement against the Vietnam War. Others interpreted it as the Beatles protesting the record company's policy of <<butchering>> their albums for the North American market. In response to retailers' outrage at the gory subject matter, Capitol immediately withdrew the LP and replaced the cover image with a shot of the band posed around a <<steamer>> trunk..",
    "comments": "The album's title plays on that of the song <<Yesterday>>. The original LP became a highly prized item among collectors. Since some of Capitol's pressing plants merely pasted the trunk image onto the existing LP covers, the album also encouraged a phenomenon of stripping back the top layer of artwork in the search for a banned butcher cover. Having been deleted from Capitol's catalogue in 1986, Yesterday and Today was reissued on CD in 2014.",

In the United States, it topped the Cash Box albums chart and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart while 1967–1970 reached the top spot. The album was re-released in September 1993 on compact disc, charting at number 3 in the UK. The album was instigated by Apple Records manager Allen Klein shortly before he was dismissed from his position. Even though the group had success with cover versions of songs, particularly <<Twist and Shout>>, 1962–1966 contains only songs composed by the Beatles. The album omits any George Harrison compositions from the era, such as <<Taxman>>, as the content is entirely Lennon–McCartney originals.",
    "comments": "As with 1967–1970, the compilation was created by Apple and EMI/Capitol Records in response to a bootleg collection titled Alpha Omega, which had been sold on television the previous year. Print advertising for the two records made a point of declaring them <<the only authorized collection of the Beatles>>. The success of the two official double LP compilations inspired Capitol's repackaging of the Beach Boys' 1960s hits, starting with the 1974 album Endless Summer.",

    "comments": "Unlike the 1962–1966 collection, the Blue Album was largely the same in the US and UK, although there were some variations. The US edition had <<Strawberry Fields Forever>> in its original 1967 stereo mix while both <<Penny Lane>> and <<Hello, Goodbye>> were presented in fake stereo, and <<I Am the Walrus>> with a four-beat electric piano introduction; the UK version had the more common six-beat beginning. The albums had several other variants and anomalies. <<Get Back>> was described as the album version in the US liner notes, although it was in fact the single version. In both countries, <<Hey Jude>> was around nine seconds shorter than it had been on the original single, although the full length was restored for the 1993 compact disc edition. The original vinyl version faded in during the crowd noise at the beginning of <<A Day in the Life>>. The fade in was different on both the UK and US versions. The original compact disc edition, meanwhile, featured a clean version previously heard on the Imagine: John Lennon soundtrack album in 1988. In the Spanish edition <<One After 909>> replaced <<The Ballad of John and Yoko>>, a song that had been banned from the airwaves shortly after being released as a single in 1969, for its allusions to <<Christ>> and <<Gibraltar>> in the lyrics",

    "description": "The Beatles Collection is a box set of the Beatles' vinyl albums released in the United States in November 1978 and the following month in the United Kingdom. It contains the official catalogue of the Beatles in stereo, and a new compilation called Rarities. The American issue by Capitol Records contained the British pressings of the same 12 original albums, with the American pressing of Rarities. The latter differed from its British counterpart in that it included the previously released English-language versions of <<She Loves You>> and <<I Want to Hold Your Hand>>, rather than the German-language version found on the British Rarities compilation. The American edition of the box set was a limited edition of only 3000 numbered copies. The limited availability of the American release resulted in the British release becoming popular as an import into the US.",

There is an extremely rare 8 track tape version of this album, which approximately 10 to 15 copies still exist today. Legend has it that Capitol Records decided to pull the plug on the release at the last minute, as 8 tracks were not selling well in late 1982, and all copies were to be destroyed.
